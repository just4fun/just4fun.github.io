## About me

I'm a software developer 💻 who was born, educated, and now also working in Chengdu 🐼, China.

I'm mainly focus on JavaScript development, including frontend, iOS (react native), node.

During the time away from work, I like running 🏃, kick-boxing 🥊, and learning Japanese language 🇯🇵.

- I have gone to many cities to attend full marathon.
- I'm still been training in a fight club twice every week.
- I have got JLPT (Japanese-Language Proficiency Test) N2 certificate many years ago.
