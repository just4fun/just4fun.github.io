## My Role

- Oct 2015 - Now: **Design and develop by myself**. react native was published in the early of 2015 and redux became popular in the middle of 2015. At that time, I wanted to create a side project to practise react and also learn redux. I chose to make an app during the National holiday of 2015 since I'm an Apple big head. react native was `v0.12.0` when I created the app, it had lots of issues and less features. After I created it for almost one year with more features and bug fixes from official and community, I decided to publish it to Apple Store, since a product should be used by customers. Now I'm still maintain it with feedback from students, upgrade with new packages version, and also refactor code with best practise.
