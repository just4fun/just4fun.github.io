  - D3 (To build different kinds of charts)
- Backend
  - Rails (Mainly provide API)

## My Role

- Oct 2014 - Oct 2016: `Front end developer`. I worked as front end developer lead in whole team with 3 other China front end guys and 4 more North American front end guys. In routine work, we did pair programming with NA guys sometimes. We used scrum for our project, and I always had a sense to control the front end team to gain best productivity and less issues. I also flew to North American two times during this period to resolve communication gap between two teams and build relationship with our NA team.

- Oct 2016 - Feb 2018: `Associate Manager, Software Development`. I was promoted to associate manager when I worked for this team two years. In addition to do code review for my team members and do communication with other roles (QA, product team), I also start to work on people management and project management.

## Achievement

- This project has been praised by CEO in whole company twice in 2015 and 2016.
- This project has best code style and quality according to team members who worked for this project then moved to other project.
