## How

Separation between frontend and backend.

- Frontend
  - create-react-app
  - React
  - PostCSS
  - socket.io-client
  - enzyme
- Backend
  - Express
  - socket.io

## My Role

- Jun 2017 - Dec 2017: `Design and develop by me and another workmate`. We used `create-react-app` to create the strcuture, and added some custom configuration to support something like `PostCSS`. Both of us were working on both sides, in this way we could learn from each other. We used `Travis` and `shipit` to support `Continuous Delivery`.
