## How

Separation between frontend and backend.

- Frontend
  - create-react-app
  - React
  - PostCSS
  - socket.io-client
  - enzyme
- Backend
  - Express
  - socket.io

## My Role

- Jun 2017 - Dec 2017: **Design and develop by my friend [hyjk2000](https://hyjk2000.github.io/) and me**. We used `create-react-app` to create the strcuture, and added some custom configuration to support something like `PostCSS`. Both of us were working on both sides, in this way we could learn from each other. We used `Travis` and `shipit` to support `Continuous Delivery`.

## Achievement

- There are more than 10 teams in ACTIVE Network using this tool in their agile meetings
- I have been asked to move the project to internal project by many managers (I rejected and hope keeping it open source)
